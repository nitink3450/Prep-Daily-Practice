//A.if block ?

//it helps to check the condition :
//1.if the condition mentioned is true then we execute the if block.(we enter into{}).... else we dont execute the if block{}.
//2.only one of the block gets executed as per condition check.
// let x = 2;
// if (x > 1 ){//the condition is true hence the block will be execute
//     console.log("condition is true hence i am inside the if block");
// }

//B.if else block:

// if the condition is true then the is block is executed and if the condition isn't true
// then the else block will be executed.
//the else block never checks for any condition.

//question: case: if a student scores more than or equal to 40,
//then he/she will pass the exam,otherwise will fails the exam.print the pass or fails status accordingly
//whenever we have to check the equakity of the values for some variables,we check it using double equal to sign (==)


// let marks = 50;// for input prompt()
// if(marks >= 40){
//     console.log("passed");
// }
// else{
//     console.log("failed");
// }


//C.if (else if) and else block:

///if block is same as above 
//first we check for if blocks condition.if, the if blocks conditions is true then the if block gets executed otherwise
//wee move to the elseif block
//elseif block also has a condition to check, if that condition is true then the elseif block gets executed,
//otherwise the else block executed,and as usual there is no condition checking for the else block.

//Question: if age is less than 18 ,then print child,else if age is greater than equal to 18 and less than 60,then print adult,otherwise print senior citizen.

// let age = 59 ;
// if(age < 18 ){
//     console.log("child");
// } else if (age >= 18 && age < 60){
//     console.log("adult");
// }
// else{
//     console.log("senior citizen");
// }

//Switch statements:

//it is used to handle more than or equal to 4 statements(also we can use if elseif elseif else but its too lenghti)

let number = 4;
switch (number){
    case 1:
